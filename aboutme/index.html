    <h2>Jess</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Jessica Rivero and I am from Venezuela.</p> 
    <p>Currently, I am studying Web Fundamentals at BYU Idaho</p> 
    <p>and before this studied Graphic Design in my country,</p> 
    <p>but I wanted to explore this career because have never</p> 
    <p>worked in this area before and I hope to achieve this goal</p>
    <p>to diversify my knowledge and have other opportunities for jobs.</p>
